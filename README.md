## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

* Python 3.6.x
* Jupyter Notebook - as a useful tool to improve readability of the Jupyter Notebooks I recommend the [Unofficial Jupyter Extensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

...becoming a Data Scientist, duh. The Data Scientist Nanodegree course contains 4 projects, with the questions of interest differing for each one:

The First Project was about selecting a dataset of my own choice, come up with some questions I wanted to find out more about and then analyze the dataset accordingly. The analysis results should be presented in a blog post for a broader audience.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains a Notebook "Project_1.ipynb", as well as some exploratory Python scripts I used to practice.

To complete the project, the following publicly available data was used:
* Results from the annual [Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## Results<a name="results"></a>
In Project 1, I took a look at Stackoverflows 2020 Developer Survey, trying to find out more on job satisfaction among developers and what they are looking for most in a job. Methods included binning data into different groups for comparison, normalizing those data to compare results with the overall average, as well as extracting information from multiple choice answers.

Looking for the key takeaways? You'll find them in this [blog post](https://andrea-s-schulz.medium.com/assessing-job-satisfaction-what-are-developers-looking-for-in-a-job-573e8107d068).

Shout out to:
* Stack Overflow for providing their data online.
* Github for their official [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/assets/notebook-writing.html)
